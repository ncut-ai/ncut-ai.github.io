# How many of you think that Islam is not a religion of peace?

I'm going to go out on a limb ([lɪm]肢，翼;大树枝;分支;枝干;) and say that I don't believe it's a religion of peace.

Neither do I believe it's a religion of violence.

Like virtually every religion, it is a religion of whatever each individual Muslim interprets it to be. As far as I can see, the vast majority of Muslims interpret it in a way that favors peace. I believe that many of the fundamental scriptures of the Islamic faith reflect a desire for peace and that one of Muhammad’s primary aims was to create a peaceful society. But as long as some Muslims maintain such violent interpretations, the religion as a whole cannot be deemed (认为，相信，视为) entirely peaceful.

Let me put it this way: I think it is stupid and bigoted （bigoted[ˈbɪɡətɪd]adj. 偏执的，顽固的，心胸狭窄的;古板;泥;） to believe that the mere （adj. 仅仅，只不过；小的，轻微的） fact of being a Muslim makes a person more violent or dangerous. At the same time, I don't think that the mere fact of being a Muslim makes someone more peaceful or less violent. People are people and people are diverse.

I was a Christian for many years. To me, Christianity was a religion of both conscientious （[ˌkɑːnʃiˈenʃəs]adj. 认真的，勤勤恳恳的;） pacifism （反战主义，和平主义） and total acceptance. Mine was a Christianity in which there was no Jew nor Greek, Slave nor Free, Male nor Female, but we were all one in Christ. My Christianity could never justify going to war to shoot my brothers and sisters over the petty materialistic struggles of this mortal world of dust and shadows in which we briefly find ourselves.

But you know what? My Christianity was not Christianity as a whole. Christianity is a religion of peace but it is also a religion of war, of acceptance but also exclusion, of both tolerance and bigotry （偏执，顽固，盲从）, and of as many other things as its adherents make it. The same is true of Islam.

I think that it is likely that, for most of the Muslims who read this, Islam is indeed a religion of peace. To them I say salaam （行额手礼） and please understand that I am not in any way trying to support the Islamophobia that has become so prevalent （流行） these days. I am merely pointing out that Islam clearly means something different to you than it does to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and that, as such, I think it is hard to build an argument for Islam being inherently peaceful without resorting to the “no true Scotsman” fallacy （谬误）. Islam is different things to different people, no matter how much you would like to believe that your interpretation is the only real one.

In your defense, however, I'm not sure that any religion can be accurately described as a religion of peace except perhaps Jainism （耆那教）. Unless your religion unilaterally forbids its adherents from engaging in any form of violence or war under any circumstances, it is capable of being made violent.

I am ready to join together with all peaceful people of all religious backgrounds to promote a future of love and respect for everyone. To quote the great Bob Dylan, “you can be in my dream if I can be in yours”.

Peace.
