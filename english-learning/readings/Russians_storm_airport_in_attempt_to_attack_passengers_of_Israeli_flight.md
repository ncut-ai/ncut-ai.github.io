# Russians storm airport in attempt to attack passengers of Israeli flight

No Israelis were injured, but about 20 people have been injured and are currently receiving medical treatment, according to local health officials.

A swarm of local residents in Makhachkala in the Russian Republic of Dagestan stormed an airport in the city in an attempt to attack any Jews and Israelis set to arrive on a "Red Wings" flight from Tel Aviv on Sunday, according to local media reports. 

No Israeli casualties were reported from the incident according to the Israel Foreign Ministry, although about 20 people have been injured and are currently receiving medical treatment according to Dagestani health officials. 

According to N12, the pilots were warned of the mob and rerouted the plane to land at a nearby airport. The rioters reached that one as well. The flight staff ordered the locking of all aircraft exits, while security forces closed the area off. Russian aviation authority Rosaviatsia said all aircraft were diverted to other airports. A security source said that a small number of Israelis and Jews were secured in the airport, and were set to be evacuated to Moscow "at the earliest convenience."

The Prime Minister’s Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the National Security Council are monitoring the situation, amd said that "Israel expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis."

Footage reportedly from the scene shared on local Telegram channels showed a hoard of people, Muslim pro-Palestinians, chanting "Allahu Akbar" and stopping cars to check the documents of passengers, ensuring they were not Israeli or Jewish, carrying Palestinian flags. In one of the videos that circulated social media, a rioter can be heard saying: "We are here for the Jews, we came to kill them with knives and shoot at them." 

The Republic of Dagestan, which sits along the coast of the Caspian Sea, is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation. There are an estimated 400 Jewish families in the region, with a 2012 survey indicating that 83% of the population is Muslim. 

In Khasavyurt, also located in Dagestan, rioters gathered at a hotel where Israelis who had fled the fighting were reported to be staying, with some of the rioters entering the hotel and only leaving after ensuring that no Israelis were in the hotel.

The Prime Minister’s Office and the Foreign Ministry stressed on Sunday that “The State of Israel takes seriously attempts to harm Israeli citizens and Jews everywhere.”

Former chief rabbi of Moscow and the chairman of the Conference of European Rabbis Pinchas Goldschmidt said the CER is "concerned about the situation of the Jews in Dagestan, with the reports of calls for pogroms against the Jews in the republic’s cities. President [Vladimir] Putin is responsible for the peace of the Jews in his country and we hope that he will give an unequivocal instruction to the local government not to allow riots and pogroms against the Jews.”

If we're gonna bring in a little more context, what's happening here is due to Dagestan being filled with hardcore Islamists, not the blond Slavs that we associate with Moscow. This part of the Russia Caucasus高加索 is a hotbed温床 for jihadist recruitment. 

Sure, they count as "Russian" but the similarities pretty much end there. A headline that provides more clarity would be ‘Russian Islamists attack Israeli flight passengers’.

It's only going to get worse: Russia has a very very low fertility rate. Guess which section of Russian society has a high fertility rate? Dagestani and Chechen Muslims.

Russia may be 30-40% (extremist) Muslim very soon. They've gone for <10% Muslim to 18% Muslim in 10 years. And these aren't your fled-from-Iran Muslims who are scientists and doctors.

That's both completely correct but also doesn't recognize the very real impact of decades of Soviet administration. In reality, they have some radically different cultural values - and yet, some that are quite similar. Such as state-sponsored violence and anti-Semitism, to name two that are relevant right here.

Have you ever heard of the term "Caucasian"? That's what the Dagestan people are. No, not blond slavs, they're Caucasians. That being where the Causasian Mountains are. So, they're white. As white as white can be...whiteness in its more pure form, and yet, also... hardcore Islamist.

"That is a white child. That is a Caucasian, from the mountains of Caucasus. That is a Slavic baby, a viking from Iceland."

Other airports to fly into to, and they chose this one? Bad move. 

I bet you didnt visit Moscow in last 10-20 years... non-slavs are dominant in Moscow now. 

Here is more context: Dagestan used to be a home to Mountain Jews - Jews from Iran that moved there about 200 years ago. When Soviet Union broke up, they all left, most to Israel, and a lot of them to Sderot. Which is the biggest town close to Gaza, that suffered the most on October 7th. 

    The Russian Echo FM radio reported that a resident of Dagestan stated “I went into every room, I checked every person. I looked at the passport, looked at the face to see if this face corresponded to the passport. There are no [Jews] there, brothers, you are simply being provoked. We need to go home. Well done to everyone who came, you’re all caring.”

Sounds like someone calming down a bunch of irritated被激怒的 toddlers 小孩.

but he pretty much says "if there were jews i would join the lynch" 私刑

I'd like to believe he's saying that so they'll think he's one of them and has no reason to hide jews, but i know better unfortunately 

I've done this. If you want to convince them of something, you have to pretend you're one of them, or they look at you as "enemy information". 

It's not impossible or even implausible难以置信的，不太可能的. Probable, well, that's debatable. 

Strange these shining defenders of justice don’t have the same reaction to what’s going on in China. 

Well they suck on Chinese co*k, hoping it replaces US as global superpower. For them that's a small sacrifice for a larger goal. 

Their alliance blows my mind. China as the global superpower is worse for Russia long-term, especially if it's based on the premise前提 of more powerful countries getting to take the territory of weaker countries. 



World: "America sucks and is evil!"

"Something happens"

World: "Woo America, please save us from big bad foreign countries!"

Convenient for everyone else outside America.

In their version of history West has always been their enemy; hated and dreamed of destroying and genociding them. On the contrary they see China as ally against evil West, whom they almost never had quarrels with, so surely they have nothing to be afraid of /s

In my experience, Palestine supporters rarely care about Syrians, Chechens and Uyghurs. 

They rarely care about Palestinians too. Not beyond the point where they no longer serve as an easy cover against accusations of antisemitism. 

When western countries brought up a resolution at the UN to condemn China for their atrocities on Uyghurs, Arab countries voted it down! Over a million Muslims in Chinese concentration camps with gang rapes and forced abortions and mass murders. 6000 mosques in China destroyed in the span of 5 years. Arab countries refused to denounce that!! The same Arab countries that won’t take in Palestinians trying to escape war and the same Arab countries that literally drafted a law making Palestinian citizenship illegal!! They don’t give the slightest fuck about Palestinians. They just hate the Jews. 



Because Israel is different than Syria, Russia or China (those commiting crimes against the above mentioned parties). While I admit Europe should not have waiting so long until the full scale invasion of Ukraine to cut ties with Russia, it has beside economical also relatively strong cultural ties with Israel. This signals that we want strong, close bonds with the Israelis but it should also mean that we should be extra vocal against Israel when they do things that clearly go against European values. The fact that Russia and China don't abide to European values is pretty obvious and the reason why our relations with those countries are limited to the strict necessary.

My support for Palestine is more a protest against the lack of vocality against Israel.

China is putting them in reeducation camps to combat their radicalization and you guys hate China for it, but Israel straight up murders all of them and you guys applaud. Propaganda has really brainwashed all of you. 



You know nothing yet you shoot a stray at china because you have been slowly conditioned for the next war.

China doesn’t bomb Muslims, they give them employment opportunities and education. They try to integrate them into their society peacefully. They denounce extremism and promote harmony.

Ask yourself why your media does not tell you the truth.

Muslims in china and minorities have more rights than Han people. If it’s a genocide then why has uhyger population risen from 3 to 12 million? Why hasn’t any Muslim country come out against china? Why does china allow a uhyger actresses to be one of chinas most popular celebrities?

You are a fanatic just on a different side and you think you are righteous just like the other zealots.
